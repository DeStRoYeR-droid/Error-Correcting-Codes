# Error-Correcting-Codes 👨🏾‍💻

---

## Introduction

Error correcting codes, as the name suggests, is a way to transmit messages as binary numbers in such a way that even if some bits are flipped, the original message can be recovered. Thus these are practically used in all instances of message transmission, and even more in data storage, to prevent data corruption in all the instances.

This repository contains implementation of Error Correcting Codes (ECC for short) in C++ along with proper in-code documentation. 📝

## Menu

The following ECC's have been discussed in this repository so far 😉-

- [Hamming Code (Code ✔, documentation 😓)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_code)
- [Cyclic Redundancy Check (Code ✔, documentation 😓)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check)
