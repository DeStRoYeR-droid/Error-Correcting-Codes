# Error-Correcting-Codes 👨🏾‍💻

---

This repository contains implementation of Error Correcting Codes (ECC for short) in C++ along with proper in-code documentation. 📝

---

The following ECC's have been discussed in this repository so far 😉-

- [Hamming Code (Code ✔, documentation 😓)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_code)
- [Cyclic Redundancy Check (Code ✔, documentation 😓)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check)
